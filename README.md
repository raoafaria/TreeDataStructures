# Tree Data Structures in Python

This project provides a complete Python implementation of three fundamental **binary tree data structures**:

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **AVL Tree (Self-Balancing)**
- **Red-Black Tree (Simplified)**

Each tree supports essential operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and inorder traversal. The program is fully interactive and menu-driven, designed for educational use and clarity.

## 📌 Features

### ✅ Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Unbalanced binary search tree
- Operations: `insert`, `delete`, `search`, and `inorder traversal`

### ✅ AVL Tree
- Height-balanced binary search tree
- Includes automatic rebalancing using left/right rotations
- Operations: `insert`, `delete`, `search`, and `inorder traversal`

### ✅ Red-Black Tree (Simplified)
- Set-based abstraction for functional demonstration
- Emulates balancing via built-in data structure
- Operations: `insert`, `delete`, `search`, and `inorder traversal`

## 🧪 Functional Capabilities

- Interactive selection of tree type at runtime
- Real-time insertion, deletion, and search
- Inorder traversal visualization for structural validation
- Input validation for all operations

## 🛠️ How to Run

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tree-data-structures.git
cd tree-data-structures
### Step 2: Execute the Program
python tree_implementations.py

### 📋 Menu Options
After launching the script, users can interact with the following:

## Tree Selection
1: Binary Search Tree (BST)

2: AVL Tree

3: Red-Black Tree (Simplified)

4: Exit the program

## Operations per Tree
Insert: Add an element

Search: Check for the existence of an element

Delete: Remove an element if present

Inorder Traversal: Print the current tree contents (in sorted order)

Back: Return to tree selection menu

###  Notes
The AVL Tree implementation includes full height tracking and rebalancing logic.

The Red-Black Tree is simplified to use Python’s built-in set for demonstrating interface and logic.

This project is ideal for understanding how tree structures work and how they differ in balancing mechanisms.
